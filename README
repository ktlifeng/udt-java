# UDT Java implementation
#

This is a native Java implementation of the UDT protocol.
The UDT protocol has been developed by Yunhong Gu and 
Robert Grossmann from the University of Illinois, and provides
high-speed data transfer with configurable congestion control.

#
# Using UDT-Java
#

UDT-Java can be used as a library for developing your own 
applications, and it can be used as-is as a commandline tool for 
file transfer.

#
# File transfer applications
#

We provide "send-file" and "receive-file" scripts that work analogously 
to their C++ counterparts.

To start a file "server",

  bin/send-file <server_port>
  
To download a file from the server,

  bin/receive-file <server_host> <server_port> <remote_filename> <local_filename>
  
where the <server_host> can be a server name or a numerical IP address.

#
# Setting up a development environment using Eclipse
#

If you want to work with the UDT-Java source code, you need to first
checkout the sourcecode from Sourceforge using Subversion:

  svn checkout http://udt-java.sourceforge.net/svnroot/udt-java/udt-java/trunk udt-java

You will need Apache Maven from http://maven.apache.org

To generate Eclipse project files,

  cd udt-java
  mvn eclipse:eclipse
  
Then, open Eclipse and import the project into your workspace, using 
"Import/Existing projects into workspace...".
